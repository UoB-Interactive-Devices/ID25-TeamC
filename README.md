## Manifesto
The digital pet :
- can understand what you want through your interaction and can give a helpful/entertaining/comforting response
- is something that seems a bit alive/ animal like
- creates a emotional attachment to it (ie because it's cute)
- won't do something that could negatively impact you on purpose
- can come with you/portable and is smaller than you



## Intial Ideas


 1.	Little Chef:
- Helps people who don’t like cooking/ aren’t use to it
- Tells you recipes
- Sets timers if needed
- Check what steps you have done and tells you when to do next step
-	Has a bowl which weighs the food
-	Tell me a fact while you cook setting
-	Can do voice activated or press its head






2.	Grow-U
-	Pet grows when you do enough steps/ do your workout
-	Grows when you get enough sleep
-	Study
-	water
