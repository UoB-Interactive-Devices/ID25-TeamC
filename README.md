## Manifesto
The digital pet :
- can understand what you want through your interaction and can give a helpful/entertaining/comforting response
- is something that seems a bit alive/ animal like
- creates a emotional attachment to it (ie because it's cute)
- won't do something that could negatively impact you on purpose
- can come with you/portable and is smaller than you
